# Portfolio Website with Bootstrap and Flask

This repository contains the code for my personal portfolio website, which I built using Bootstrap for styling and Flask for the backend. The website showcases my projects, skills, and other relevant information.

## Getting Started

1. **Prerequisites:**
   - Make sure you have Python and Flask installed on your system.
   - Familiarity with HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap will be helpful.

2. **Installation:**
   - Clone this repository to your local machine.
   - Navigate to the project directory.

3. **Setting Up the Environment:**
   - Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended).
   - Install the required dependencies:
     ```bash
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```

4. **Running the Application:**
   - Execute the following command to start the Flask development server:
     ```bash
     python app.py
     ```
   - The website will be accessible at `http://localhost:5000/`.

## Project Structure

- `app.py`: The main Flask application file.
- `templates/`: Contains HTML templates for different pages.
  - `signin.html`: Sign-in page.

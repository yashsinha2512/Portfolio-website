This project is a simple chat client application built using Pythonâ€™s socket module for networking and Tkinter for creating a graphical user interface (GUI). Users can connect to a server, send and receive messages, and export chat history. The dark-themed UI adds a modern touch, and the Enter key functionality makes messaging seamless.
